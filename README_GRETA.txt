# GreenTags (GRETA)

This site contains the results of the Italian project 

"Green tags and sensors with utrawideband identification and localization capabilities (GRETA)"

Funded (Euro 1.156.976) by the MINISTERO DELL'ISTRUZIONE, DELL'UNIVERSITÀ E DELLA RICERCA

Period: Feb 2013 - Feb 2016

The purpose of this project is to realize a demonstrator of a wireless ecological system for identification, tracking, and monitoring of mobile subjects (persons and things). The intention is to employ:
i) zero-power UWB communication techniques;
ii) energy harvesting solutions;
iii) eco-compatible materials.

The project activity is oriented towards the best exploitation of the energy available in the operating environment and adoption of all the concepts, both in design and implementation, known as “green electronics”.
To reconcile the maximum general validity of the expected results with the need to define precisely the technical and performance requirements for the development of the demonstrator, a significant application has been identified among those indicated in Horizon 2020.
